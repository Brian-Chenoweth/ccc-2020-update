            <p>Now I would like to talk about the reasons why I decided to become a teacher.</p>
            
            <p>Since I was young, I remember when I lived in Puerto Rico, I always played the teacher with my little sister. She was the student. I arranged all the dolls and stuffed animals around pretending I was teaching them all. That was something that at a very early stage of my life, I knew that was my vocation. I was going to be a teacher. That was one of my passions.</p>
            
            <p>I love art and I love to express and to teach kids through art.</p>
            
            <p>I love creating different games, I love to come up with new activities that will keep kids motivated and engaged.</p>

            <p>In regards to my job at this preschool, I think that I’ve felt really grateful because the kids have showed me a lot of interest in learning a second language.</p>

            <p>At the beginning of my time here, I felt a little scared about not having any interest from the kids to learn Spanish but I’ve been surprised! The kids really love it!</p>

            <p>They really want to learn new words every single time they have the chance to learn.</p>

            <p>When we go outside to explore, they asked me, “Daisy, how do you say this in Spanish? How do you say this phrase?”</p>
