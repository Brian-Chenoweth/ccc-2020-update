            <p>Greetings! My name is Daisy Bátiz. I am a Spanish teacher and I work as a team with Nicole.</p>   

            <p>I am going to tell you a little about me, I am from Puerto Rico and I studied there as a Special Needs teacher. I have three years of working experience in the education field and this is my first year working in an Immersion program, teaching Spanish as a second language.</p>

            <p>Working here has been a very enriching experience for me and I have had the opportunity to learn a lot from Nicole. She has taught me different teaching techniques that I haven’t taught before.</p> 

            <p>I really, really like how she works. Her way of teaching is completely new to me.</p>  

            <p>I like that the kids learn from nature and they have the opportunity to explore and that the kids are the ones deciding what topics they are interested in learning.</p>

            <p>The one thing that has captured my attention is that the kids really want to learn Spanish.</p>

            <p>I really think that has been part of my daily motivation and it has been something that honestly speaking has been one of the most important experiences that I have had.</p>
